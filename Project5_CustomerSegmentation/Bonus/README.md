# Advanced Clustering Techniques – AI/ML Project

This project explores advanced clustering methods and dimensionality reduction techniques to derive insights from customer data. It goes beyond K-Means clustering by incorporating DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). A real-world business scenario is also developed to demonstrate the strategic application of these techniques.

## 💡 Features

### 📊 DBSCAN Clustering
- Implemented DBSCAN to identify complex customer groupings beyond spherical clusters.
- Compared DBSCAN performance with K-Means and hierarchical clustering.
- Analyzed density-based clusters for hidden behavioral patterns.

### 🧬 Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
- Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce data complexity.
- Visualized PCA results in 2D space and assessed impact on clustering quality.
- Explained how dimensionality reduction simplifies modeling and aids interpretability.

### 🌍 Real-World Scenario
- Developed a retail business case leveraging advanced segmentation.
- Justified the use of PCA and DBSCAN to improve personalized marketing.
- Presented how data-driven decisions can drive revenue and customer engagement.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- DBSCAN, PCA, K-Means, Hierarchical clustering
